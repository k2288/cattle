# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - assets/images/dry_cow.svg
   - assets/images/milk.svg
   - assets/images/milking_cow.svg
   - assets/images/total_cow.svg
   - assets/images/cow.jpeg
   - assets/images/milking.svg
   - assets/images/fertilization.svg

   
   - assets/images/state/bull.png
   - assets/images/state/calf.png
   - assets/images/state/cow.png
   - assets/images/state/heifer.png

   - assets/images/state/breeding.png
   - assets/images/state/calved.png
   - assets/images/state/onmilking.png
   - assets/images/state/pragnent.png
   - assets/images/state/weaned.png
   - assets/images/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Iran_Sans
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Iran_Sans.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
